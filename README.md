## Lifetime Income Estimator

This application will estimate your lifetime earning potential based on your
current age, your gender, your education level, and a range of working years.
It will also take into account whether or not you have completed the Data
Science specialization from Coursera!

The income model is based on US census data from 1991 to 2014 for workers
ranging from 18 to 65+ years of age. The application will try to extrapolate
to working years as early as 1976 and as far into the future as 2030, but
it won't allow for a working years before your were 18, nor will it allow
a retirement year that is less than or equal to a staring work year.

To use the application, simply move the age slider to your current age,
select your gender with the appropriate radio button, select your education
level from the drop down list, select your starting work year and your
retirement year with the working years sliders, and select the 'yes' or 'no'
radio button to indicate if you are completing the Data Science
specialization. The application will automatically update with a graph
showing your income (in thousands of dollars) each working year as well as
showing you your total lifetime income.

Obviously, as this model is based on median income census data from the
United States, this model will not be at all applicable outside the US,
and should not be considered as any kind of serious financial planning
tool for anyone.
